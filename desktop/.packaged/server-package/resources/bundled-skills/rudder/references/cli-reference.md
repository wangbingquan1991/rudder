# Rudder Agent CLI Reference

Stable CLI contract for agents using the bundled `rudder` skill. Prefer these commands over direct `/api` calls.

## Defaults

- All commands support `--json`.
- `--org-id` defaults to `RUDDER_ORG_ID` when relevant.
- `--run-id` defaults to `RUDDER_RUN_ID` and is attached to mutating requests when available.
- `issue checkout` defaults `--agent-id` from `RUDDER_AGENT_ID`.

## Issue Close-Out Signals

Before a successful `todo` or `in_progress` issue run exits, leave one close-out signal with the command that matches the outcome:

- progress remains: `rudder issue comment <issue> --body <text>`
- work is complete: `rudder issue done <issue> --comment <text>`
- work is blocked: `rudder issue block <issue> --comment <text>`
- ownership changes: add an explicit handoff comment before or with the assignee update

If `RUDDER_WAKE_REASON=issue_passive_followup`, the run is close-out governance for the same issue. Inspect current issue state first, then leave a progress comment, completion, blocker, or explicit handoff.
