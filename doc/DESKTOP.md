# Rudder Desktop

Rudder Desktop is the Electron-packaged local-first distribution of Rudder V1. It runs the existing board UI and local API inside a desktop shell, but it no longer owns a separate Rudder data directory.

Desktop, browser, and CLI surfaces now attach to the same local Rudder instance for the selected profile.
On first launch, packaged Desktop also attempts to export a `rudder` shell command by
installing a small wrapper script into a writable bin directory and routing CLI calls
back through the installed Desktop executable. Development Desktop runs do not install
or manage the `rudder` command.

## Scope

Current desktop scope is intentionally narrow:

- bundled local instance only
- `local_trusted` only
- packaged app uses a resident shell lifecycle
- no update detection or auto-update yet
- no launch-at-login
- no remote-instance connection mode

## Commands

From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:watch
pnpm dev:reset
pnpm desktop:verify
pnpm prod
pnpm desktop:build
pnpm desktop:dist
pnpm --filter @rudderhq/desktop smoke
node desktop/scripts/smoke.mjs --mode=packaged
npx @rudderhq/cli@latest start
```

Recommended defaults:

- `pnpm dev` starts the non-watch local `dev` runtime first, then opens the development Desktop shell against that same shared instance
- `pnpm dev:watch` starts the watched local `dev` runtime first, then opens the development Desktop shell against that same shared instance
- `pnpm desktop:verify` is the default contributor validation flow for Desktop work: dev-shell smoke, packaged build, then packaged-app smoke
- `pnpm prod` builds the packaged portable Desktop artifact for the current platform, verifies the packaged app boots successfully, and then opens the local app artifact
- `npx @rudderhq/cli@latest start` is the public first-run form; after the
  persistent CLI exists, `rudder start` is the equivalent direct form. Both
  check for newer CLI releases and install/launch the matching portable Desktop
  asset from the GitHub Release when needed.

Low-frequency escape hatches:

- `RUDDER_DESKTOP_RESIDENT_SHELL=1 pnpm dev:watch` keeps the shared `dev` profile but forces resident tray/menu lifecycle for local debugging
- `pnpm --filter @rudderhq/desktop dev` runs only the development Desktop shell
- `pnpm rudder run` is the persistent local `prod_local` runtime entrypoint that packaged Desktop attaches to
- `pnpm desktop:dist` builds portable release artifacts without opening them

Smoke scenarios:

- `pnpm --filter @rudderhq/desktop smoke` runs the clean-instance desktop smoke path.
- `node desktop/scripts/smoke.mjs --mode=packaged` now runs both a clean packaged smoke path and an upgrade smoke path that downgrades the temp `prod_local` schema before relaunching.
- Pass `--scenario=clean`, `--scenario=upgrade`, or `--scenario=all` to target a specific smoke path manually.

## Local profiles

Desktop follows the same local profiles as the rest of Rudder:

- unpackaged development Desktop defaults to `dev`
- packaged Desktop defaults to `prod_local`
- `RUDDER_LOCAL_ENV` overrides either default

That means:

- `pnpm dev` and `pnpm dev:watch` share `~/.rudder/instances/dev/`
- `pnpm rudder run`, default local CLI usage, and packaged Desktop share `~/.rudder/instances/default/`

## Lifecycle behavior

Desktop now has intentionally different lifecycle behavior in development vs packaged builds.

### Development shell

`pnpm dev` and `pnpm dev:watch` are the two supported development entrypoints.

Development Desktop stays optimized for iteration:

- close window => quit app
- no resident tray/menu shell by default
- no hidden long-lived background process
- no automatic `rudder` shell wrapper installation; use `pnpm rudder ...` for CLI work in development

Simulation path for production resident behavior:

- `RUDDER_DESKTOP_RESIDENT_SHELL=1 pnpm dev:watch`
- this keeps the `dev` profile and development shell wiring, but exercises the same resident tray/menu control path used by packaged Desktop

This keeps the desktop dev loop predictable while sharing the same `dev` data as browser and CLI.

### Packaged shell

Packaged Desktop is the primary local shell for `prod_local`.

- close window => hide to background when resident controls are available
- explicit Quit => fully exit the shell and stop the runtime it owns
- browser and CLI can still attach to the same local instance, but they do not define packaged Desktop lifecycle
- packaged Desktop first launch is the only automatic CLI export path for the `rudder` command
- packaged Desktop refreshes `PATH` from the user's login shell and, for zsh/bash, the interactive login shell before starting the local runtime so CLI adapters like `codex` still resolve when the app is launched from Finder/menu shells and the CLI is installed through shell-managed toolchains such as nvm

Platform behavior:

- macOS: resident control lives in the menu bar; when hidden, the Dock icon is removed until the window is shown again
- Windows: resident control lives in the notification area
- Linux: resident control uses tray/AppIndicator support when the current desktop environment is likely to support it; otherwise Desktop safely falls back to windowed quit-on-close behavior

## Window chrome contract

On macOS, Rudder Desktop keeps the native traffic-light window controls while hiding the default window title text.
The app uses Electron's `titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"` so the top chrome remains a real macOS window region instead of a fake in-app replacement.

This means the top row of the app is treated as shared chrome:

- native close, minimize, and zoom buttons remain visible at the top-left
- the default title text is hidden
- Rudder content may extend into that top area, but must reserve leading space for the native buttons
- non-interactive top-bar background may act as a drag region
- interactive controls in that row must opt out of dragging so clicks, text input, and menus still work

Do not treat `hiddenInset` as "remove the title bar". It means "hide the default title presentation, keep the native macOS controls, and reuse the space intentionally".

## Data and shell paths

Rudder business data lives under the shared Rudder home:

- home: `~/.rudder`
- config: `~/.rudder/instances/<instance>/config.json`
- env file: `~/.rudder/instances/<instance>/.env`
- embedded Postgres: `~/.rudder/instances/<instance>/db`
- storage: `~/.rudder/instances/<instance>/data/storage`

Electron `userData` now stores only desktop-shell preferences such as window state. It is not the source of truth for Rudder config, database, or storage.

## Runtime coordination

Desktop does not blindly start a second local server for the same instance.

Instead it:

1. checks the shared runtime descriptor under `~/.rudder/instances/<instance>/runtime/server.json`
2. validates the existing runtime via `/api/health`
3. attaches when the runtime is healthy and compatible
4. starts a new runtime only when needed

The boot screen and Desktop settings page show the active profile, instance, runtime mode (`attached` or `owned`), server version, and the shared instance data path.

In packaged mode, resident-shell actions can restart the local runtime without changing the shared instance path.

## Smoke and isolated runs

For smoke tests or isolated manual runs, override both the shared Rudder home and the Electron shell data root:

```sh
RUDDER_HOME=/tmp/rudder-home \
RUDDER_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR=/tmp/rudder-electron \
RUDDER_LOCAL_ENV=prod_local \
pnpm --filter @rudderhq/desktop smoke
```

`RUDDER_HOME` controls shared Rudder state. `RUDDER_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR` only controls Electron shell preferences.

## Validation rules

Use this validation split when changing Desktop behavior:

- Development-shell changes:
  - `pnpm --filter @rudderhq/desktop smoke`
- Packaged boot, local prod startup, portable artifacts, icons, startup migrations, or shared-instance path changes:
  - `pnpm desktop:verify`

Do not rely on `pnpm prod` alone during development.
`pnpm prod` is a convenience wrapper that opens the local packaged app after validation.
The contributor workflow should validate first, then open artifacts only after the packaged smoke path passes.

## Reset

To reset desktop-backed Rudder data for a profile, quit the app and remove that shared instance directory, for example:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.rudder/instances/dev
rm -rf ~/.rudder/instances/default
```

The startup failure screen exposes the active instance path for the current run.

## Packaging

Desktop packaging uses Electron + electron-builder and currently produces:

- macOS: portable `.zip` containing `Rudder.app`
- Windows: portable `.zip` containing the unpacked Electron app
- Linux: `.AppImage`

The GitHub Actions desktop workflow builds artifacts on all three operating systems. Stable tags under `v*` and canary tags under `canary/v*` publish Desktop artifacts to the matching GitHub Release:

- `Rudder-X.Y.Z-macos-x64-portable.zip`
- `Rudder-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64-portable.zip`
- `Rudder-X.Y.Z-windows-x64-portable.zip`
- `Rudder-X.Y.Z-linux-x64.AppImage`
- `SHASUMS256.txt`

Before packaging, the workflow rewrites package manifests to the release tag
version. That means canary builds report `0.1.0-canary.N` from the app shell,
the bundled local server, and the packaged `rudder --version` path instead of
falling back to the committed stable base version.

Desktop artifacts are not published to npm. The CLI `start` command resolves
the appropriate GitHub Release asset for the current platform, verifies
`SHASUMS256.txt`, installs the app into a per-user location, and launches it.
The current Desktop channel is an unsigned portable alpha; signed/notarized
installer distribution can be restored after Apple and Windows code signing are
available.

Packaged Desktop checks for updates on startup against stable GitHub Releases
only. Canary and beta prereleases are ignored; if a newer stable version exists,
the app prompts the user to open the release page.
